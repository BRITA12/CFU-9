'''Guessing Game - Roll of the Dice
Ask the user “how many rolls do you want to play”
Have the computer generate a random number
HINT: see image bellow
For each roll, user guesses a random number between 1-6
They only get one guess per roll
Give the user +6 pts if they are right, -1 point if wrong 
Print the final score after all the rolls are played'''

import random

rolls = int(input("how many rolls do you want to play: "))
points = 0

for i in range(rolls):
    def round():
        x =  random.randint(1,6)
        global points
        guess = int(input("what is your guess"))
        if guess == x:
            points = points + 6
            print("you are correct!! +6 points")
        else:
            points = points -1
            print("You are incorrect!! -1 point")
    round()
print("Your final score is: " + str(points))9
